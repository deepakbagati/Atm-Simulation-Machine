This project simulates a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
It allows users to interact with their bank accounts securely by performing essential operations like checking balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing money. Account data is persistently stored in a JSON file, ensuring transactions are saved even after restarting the program.
